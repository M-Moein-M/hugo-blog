## About Me

Welcome to my blog! I'm Mohammadmoein Moradi.

### What I Do

I am studying AI Master's in FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg and working as a Research Assistant in NHR@FAU.
In my job and withing our research group, I develop AI systems on HPC environments to test different ideas related to LLMs. As my study program dictates, I am familiar with AI models and topics but my real interests are closer to MLOPs and Linux. In other words, if you have an AI workflow or program that works only on your machine, I can set up the environment to run it on HPC systems.

### This Blog

I share the lessons learned from work and projects.

My goals here are...
- sharing the technical problems I had and how I solved it
- creating a portfolio
- building a corpus of my own knowledge and thinking
- learning how to write

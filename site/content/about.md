## About Me

Welcome to my blog! I'm Mohammadmoein Moradi.

### What I Do

I am studying Master's AI in FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg and working as HiWi in NHR@FAU.
In my job and withing our research group, I manage AI systems on HPC environments to test different ideas related to LLMs and AI. My personal interest lies in MLOPs and managing AI systems on systems like HPC and not directly training AI models.

### This Blog

In this blog, I share my experiences from work and projects. My goal is to give something back and also try to be more open towards sharing what I know.
